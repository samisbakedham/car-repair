# A beautiful car service theme website

You can see the website here 👉🏻 https://car-repair.now.sh

## Installation

You can get the code by either cloning this repository using git

```
git clone https://github.com/kahasan/car-repair.git
```

... or [downloading source code](https://github.com/samisbakedham/car-repair/archive/master.zip) code as a zip archive.

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

You will see this script in package.json:

```
"dev": "next & gulp"
```

so, if you don't want to use gulp, change this line like this:

```
"dev": "next"
```

Then start the example website with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000 🚀
